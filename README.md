## Setflix is a clone of Netflix with the ability to create 'Cinemas' and watch a movie at the same time with your friends (i.e. across multiple devices). Setlix will sync the playing of the movie across all of the devices.

I have branded it to have the Netflix branding for now, but future releases will include a full rebranding more along the lines of 'Setflix'. 

Current Features:
- Sign Up (using email and password combination)
- Sign In (using email and password used during sign-up)
- Viewing of Series and Movies
- Searching for Series and Movies
- Playing of a movie/series (current placeholder is a short clip)

Upcoming Features:
- Rebrand of entire app
- Syncing of Movie/Episode across multiple devices
- Playing of the actual movies/series (still trying to figure out the licensing/legal issues around this)
- Requesting a movie to be uploaded
- A Native mobile app for Android/iOS

Technologies used:
- React (Styled components, Custom Hooks)
- Firebase (Authentication/ storing of Movie/Series data)
- Jest (Testing framework)

The web app is fully responsive and can be used on any device.
